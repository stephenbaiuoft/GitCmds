## Git Branching - Remote
Avaiable @ <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches>

### Notes
* `Remote-tracking branches` take the form `<remote>/<branch>` 
* origin/master refers to the remote branch
* you could instead run `git push origin serverfix:awesomebranch` to push your `local serverfix` branch to the `remote awesomebranch branch` project.
